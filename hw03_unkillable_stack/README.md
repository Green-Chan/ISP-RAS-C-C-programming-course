# Unkillable Stack

## Description

That is a stack that is as fragile as I can write. Each method checks if stack fields store valid values and asserts if they are not.

That is C code that enable stack to store elements of any type. (All elements in the same stack have the same type, but you can have two or more stacks with different types of elements and you can choose any type.) That is how code could look like if you need an analog of C++ templates in C.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows

* MinGW

### Installing

* download directory hw03_unkillable_stack from https://github.com/Green-Chan/ISP_RAS_programming_course .

### Building

* Open CMD

* Get to the hw03_unkillable_stack directory 
```
> cd path\to\the\directory\hw03_unkillable_stack 
```
> **Note:** If you need to change the drive from C: to D:, type "D:" (without quotes).

* Run mingw32-make
```
> mingw32-make
```
> **Note:** you may need to learn how to add MinGW\bin to the PATH (the Environment Settings section in http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started/).

### Running tests 

* Run mingw32-make with argument test
```
> mingw32-make test
```
