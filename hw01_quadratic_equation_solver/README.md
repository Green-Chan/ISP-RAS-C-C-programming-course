# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Task:

Write a function, that solves quadratic equations.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows

* MinGW

### Installing

* download directories hw01_quadratic_equation_solver and unit_tests from https://github.com/Green-Chan/ISP_RAS_programming_course . They should stay the sibling directories (have the same parent directory).

### Building

* Open CMD

* Get to the hw01_quadratic_equation_solver directory 
```
> cd path\to\the\directory\hw01_quadratic_equation_solver 
```
> **Note:** If you need to change the drive from C: to D:, type "D:" (without quotes).

* Run mingw32-make
```
> mingw32-make
```
> **Note:** you may need to learn how to add MinGW\bin to the PATH (the Environment Settings section in http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started/).

### Running tests 

* Run mingw32-make with argument test
```
> mingw32-make test
```

## Documentation

You can find documentation, generated by Doxygen in hw01_quadratic_equation_solver\documentation directory. If you have Doxygen and know how to use it, you can generate documentation yourself using Doxyfile in the same directory (hw01_quadratic_equation_solver\documentation).
